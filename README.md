## Cellular Automata

Celluar autonoma is a type of alghoritm where the state of cells changes over time based on the states of surrounding cells.
A classic example of cellular autonoma is Conway's Game of Life. A simulation of a tiny ecosistem that progresses following this set of rules:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
